Right now reload never clears the session. I think some of these reloads should clear the session. For example: if no unaccepted AI edits, and if the previous session was concluded > 1h ago (so the reverse condition of Alex's idea above)",

The error message extraction logic simply takes the first line of the hook output, which may be an informational or success message rather than the actual error. This makes it difficult for users to understand why their commit failed.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a Git hook fails, VS Code should display the actual error message that explains why the hook failed, prioritizing lines that indicate failures (e.g., \"Failed\", \"exit code\", \"hook id:\") over informational or success messages.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nVS Code shows the first line of the hook output as the error message, which could be:\n- A success message (e.g., \"Passed\", \"Skipped\", \"no files to check\")\n- An informational message that doesn't explain the actual failure\n- A message from a different hook that passed, while the actual failure is on a later line\n\nThis causes confusion as users see messages like \"Git: Passed\" or \"Git: no files to check\" when their commit actually failed due to a different hook.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Set up a Git repository with multiple pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky or similar tools)\n2. Configure one hook to pass and another to fail\n3. Attempt to commit changes in VS Code\n4. Observe the error message displayed\n\n**Example scenario:**\n- Create a pre-commit hook that runs linting\n- The linting hook outputs: \"Passed: ESLint check\" on the first line, but a later hook fails with \"Failed: Unit tests\"\n- VS Code shows: \"Git: Passed: ESLint check\" instead of the actual failure\n",

This can easily fall apart, for example, when users delete a session that’s already opened in the Chat Editor, the editor still stays open even though the session is gone. Different extensions may also choose different icons for “delete”.\n\nThis makes me wonder if “Archive” / “Delete” should be part of the core API.",
